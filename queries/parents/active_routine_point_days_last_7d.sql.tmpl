/*
Both freemium and paid parents using Beyond features in last 7 days.
Only counts days after a parent entered the experiment.
Counts unique parent-days of using Routines via the Routines sheet, not the total number of Routine activities used.
Currently, we only have context logging on iOS
Once we hook up beyond usage to the new parent.cache table we should update this query
